 This is the [DynaBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04037) model which can flexibly adjust the size and latency by selecting adaptive width and depth, on the SST-2 task from the [GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks). Refer [here](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/DynaBERT)
 for detailed training and inference guide.
